			    			Photography is an art that took many years and efforts of many individuals to perfect. 
			    			Many different people in many different fields contributed to this light writing. 
			    			Chemists, artists, inventors, and engineers all lending a crafting hand to the art. 
			    			Photography can be defined as the art of producing images of objects on photosensitive surfaces. 
			    			It is both an art and a science. As an art it expresses personal vision, and as a science it relies on technology. 
			    			The word photography came from the Greek word phos, meaning light and graphos, meaning writing, which literally means light writing. 
			    			Light writing is an emerging form of stop motion animation wherein still images, 
			    			captured using the technique known as light painting or light drawing, are put in sequence thereby creating the optical illusion 
			    			of movement for the viewer. In order to get started in creating light writing you will need a DSLR( Digital Single Lens Reflex ) camera,
			    			an ordinary DSC( Digital Still Camera ) will not do because light writing requires a camera that can be placed 
			    			in the B bulb shutter position, a remote shutter release and a tripod.
